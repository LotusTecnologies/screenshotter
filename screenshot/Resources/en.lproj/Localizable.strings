Screenshots you take that arenâ€™t relevant wonâ€™t clutter up your collection thanks to our image recognition technology.\n\nWe also programatically determine what categories your photo fits - womenâ€™s clothing, menâ€™s clothing, Kids, plus size, furniture, etc, and let you sort manually to fine tune your fashion hunt based on size, price, brands or gender.\n\nOur visual search is powered by our partners, %@";
